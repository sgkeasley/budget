## Budget Webpage

**This project uses prompts to display pre-defined income and expense objects, allowing the user to input an 
additional item for each and using session storage to store the values.  It then calculates and displays the
available disposable income, asks the user how much to put into savings and uses an alert to display the final
remaining amount.**
